## Features

- 12x BM1397 mining ASICs
- Same form factor as an ITX motherboard for fitting into commercially available cases
- Powered by the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 for an all in one machine
- 6x Voltage domains of 2x ASICS per domain to aid in repairability if a failure occurs
- ASICs are ran in parallel rather than series to minimize the "christmas tree effect" of one ASIC failing and the whole board powers off

Planned Features
- PWM Fanspeed control 
- Temperature sensors for asics and air
- Integrated serial connections through onboard serial adapter
- Integrate commercial case panel I/O pins and headers to use if needed
- Many more!
